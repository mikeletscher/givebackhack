We are the launchpad for social innovation you need to take an idea into a reality. We bring together community leaders, designers, developers, and other concerned citizens to create solutions that will help make a lasting impact.

          %li Present the idea with your team to a panel of distinguished judges, who decide top teams that are provided with resources to move forward and sustain their ideas.
